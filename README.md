## concept of the game (subject to change)
**[X]** = the number of members in your party which is 5 for the time being

You are the leader of a party and will start with one Unit, 
you will explore the world and your party will grow in size (with a maximum of **[X]**) and power (leveling, with skilltree and gear)

The exploration of the game will be done in a mount and blade fashion.

The map will generate:
- Cities (holding shops, and other oppurtunities)
- Dungeons
- Bosses
- Roaming enemy armies
- Quests

You will begin in the middle of the map and the further you expand outwards the more difficult game it becomes.

When in a combat encounter you will need to fight with your party against enemies in a rts method, you will need to micromanage your charcters 
and use their abilites and basic attacks

Roles are not a certain things because characters will be randomily generate so that fun combinations of abilities and items can happen.

Your characters can level in which they gain stat upgrades and new abilites or improvements and you can upgrade their skill tree out of combat.

But you as the player can also level in which you can upgrade a big skill tree (inspired by path of exile)

Aim of items and abilites is that you can create unique combinations that will synergize like in binding of isaac.

When characters die they will be permantally dead.

## Multiplayer
You can play with 4 players in total, of whom each can have his own squad of **[X]**.
